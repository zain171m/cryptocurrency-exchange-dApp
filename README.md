## Cryptocurrency Exchange Decentralized App

### Project Description

This decentralized application (dapp) allows users to trade ERC20 tokens. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to facilitate trades.

### Features

* Trade ERC20 tokens in a secure and decentralized manner
* View current market prices and order books
* Deposit and withdraw tokens onto the exchange
* Make Sell or Buy order, fill orders, and cancel orders
* Track your trade history through previous orders and Candle stick Chart

### How to Use

To use the dapp, you will need to have a browser with metamask wallet extention. Once you have installed the extention and made account on metamask, you can visit the dapp's website and connect your wallet.

Once you are connected, you can start trading ERC20 tokens. To do this, simply select the tokens you want to trade and the amount you want to trade. You can then place a order, cancel order, or fill order made by other users.

**To place a order**, you specify the price at which you want to buy or sell the tokens.
**To cancel order**, you can just cancel the order made by you previously.
**To fill order**, you specify the order you are interested and fill it.You will than also have to pay extra fee payment

Once you have placed an order, you can track its status in the "My Orders" "Order Book" and "Trades" section of the dapp. You can also view your trade history and other trades in the "Trades" and "Candle Stick Chart" section.

### Benefits

* **Security:** The dapp uses smart contracts to facilitate trades, which are immutable and secure.
* **Decentralization:** The dapp is not controlled by any single entity. This means that users have full control over their funds and trades.
* **Transparency:** All trades are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that they are transparent and verifiable.

### Conclusion

This ERC20 Token Exchange dapp is a secure, decentralized, and transparent way to trade ERC20 tokens. It is easy to use and offers a variety of features to help users trade effectively.

### Additional Information

* **Requirements:**
    * Web3-enabled browser
    * Ethereum wallet
* **Fees:**
    * The dapp charges a small fee for each trade. The fee is used to compensate the dapp's developers and to maintain the dapp's infrastructure.
* **Support:**
    * If you have any questions or problems using the dapp, please visit the dapp's website or contact the dapp's developers.
# Here's how you can test this project after you have metamask wallet and cloned into the repository
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
